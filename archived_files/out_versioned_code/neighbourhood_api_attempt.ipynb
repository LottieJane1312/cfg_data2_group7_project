While the code ran, another issue became clear. After extensive research, including reading a Freedom of Information Act, it was found that the Met police use 'neighbourhoods' as one geographical division, and 'LSOA codes' as another - there is no crossover/link between these LSOA codes and the 'neighbourhoods'. I spent a long time looking online for any solution, but could not solve this. At this point, we began working on a plan to reverse geocode the longitude and latitude (see neighbourhood_api_attempt_v3)"],"metadata":{"id":"C5AJqsbv2fmO"}}]}
